- Enable file name extension view in file explorer.

- You can edit the following files.
    - "EnterIDandLanguage.txt".
    - "_712_Testing.cpp" or "_712_Testing.java" or "_712_Testing.py".
    - "_712_Solution.cpp" or "_712_Solution.java" or "_712_Solution.py".
- Do not edit any of the other given files.

- Open "EnterIDandLanguage.txt" to edit the file.
    - Replace "00000000" in the first line with your ID number.
    - Replace "py" in the second line with the file extension of your language:
        "cpp" for C++ or "java" for Java or "py" for Python.
- Read the problem statement from "_712_Task.txt".
    - Find the constraints and examples.
    - Find the time limit and scoring distribution.
- Find the forbidden keywords from "_712_ForbiddenKeywords.txt".
- For testing and debugging purpose you are given a file "_712_Testing.txt".
    - Do not worry about forbidden keywords in this file.
    - Use this file on your own convenience.
- After you have thought of a solution, complete the solve() method inside
    "_712_Solution.cpp" or "_712_Solution.java" or "_712_Solution.py".
    - Do not use any external library (such as numpy, pandas) in your code.
    - Do not use any forbidden keywords in your code in this file.

- Run "_712_Checker.bat" to check the score of your solution.
    - One of the ways to run this file is from a terminal using the command
        ".\_712_Checker.bat" (after changing to the correct directory).
    - See your tentative score in a range of 0 to 1.
- Some new files are generated.
    - A file containing your ID number somewhere in its name.
        - This file contains the code for the last solution resulting the best
            tentative score you have received so far.
        - This is the file which you need to submit, your actual score will be
            revealed later after checking your file by a centralized computer.
        - If you are not satisfied with the code in this file for some reason
            then you can delete it and generate a new one.
    - If you receive a WrongAnswer verdict then "WrongAnswer.txt" might contain
        some clues (the input sizes and the inputs of a test where your solution
        was wrong) to help you correct your mistakes.
    - If you receive a TimeLimitExceeded verdict then "TimeLimitExceeded.txt"
        might also contain some clues (the test number of a batch where your
        soulution was inefficient) to help you improve your algorithm.
- Do not delete any of the given files.
- You can delete any of the generated files.
